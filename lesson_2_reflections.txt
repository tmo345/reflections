What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need it?

When you intialize a repository git creates the .git directory in the project 
folder. Now the working directory contains all the project files in addition 
to the .git directory which will contain a revision hitory for each file git 
is tracking for you over the different commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is where you do the "working" part of the equation, 
meaning it is where you are making active changes and additions to the files 
of your project. This way you can work like usual and then add changes to the 
staging area, which are then queued to be included in the next commit. So the 
staging area serves as sort of a holding for changes that will be included in 
the next commit. The value is that you can make multiple additions to to the 
staging area before making a commit. This allows you to commit changes to 
multiple files simultaneously, creating the ability to let commits contain a 
logical step in the development even when this step was the result of changes 
to multiple files at the same time. If you could only have changes go directly 
to commit from working directory, you would end up with a one file per commit 
system which would spread changes for one feature but in different files over 
multiple commits. This would be tricky to figure out where to look for a bug.

Working directory has files that been changed since last commit. You use git add to put the changed files you want into staging area. Then when you use git commit you only add what you put into staging area into the commit which goes into repository. After this the staging area now contains the contents of the last commit.

I can really think of the working area now as having a record of changes to 
the files from the previous staging/commit of the file. So you have file 
changes in working area and you have file snapshots in staging area that are 
the same as the last commit. You stage the changes that you want so that now 
the working area and staging area match. The stage is now different from the 
repository's last commit. You commit the staged changes to bring all the 
snapshots of the file in line and the commit is saved with a snapshot at that 
moment in time.
