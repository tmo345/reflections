When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be useful for collaborating with others on a 
project. Also, it can serve as a backup of your repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

One of the big benefits of a distributed version control system is that you 
can have a local full clone of a remote repository. This allows you to work on 
your repository regardless of whether you are connected to the internet. 
Manual pulls make more sense in this context. Also, if you are working 
collabortatively on a project, you might not want all of the commits to the 
remote repository to constantly update in your local one.
